        <h5>This how-to guide will show you how to create a simple Twitter bot.</h5>
        <h3>Some Preliminaries</h3>
        <p>If you are anyone who isn't me you probably have a Twitter account. Sadly, my first tweet was actually from my twitter bot's account which I made for this how-to guide.This guide assumes you have a basic knowledge of computers, HTML/CSS, and JSON (pronounced "jason"). When you are finished with this how to guide, you will know how to make a twitter bot which can post tweets from a random list of phrases. This will be a great starting point if you ever wish to create a more sophisticated bot!Here is what we'll be learning and doing</p>

        <h3>What we will learn</h3>
        <ul><ul>
        	<li>What an API is</li>
        	<li>How to get a Twitter API key</li>
        	<li>How to "make calls" or use the Twitter API</li>
        	<li>How to process the responses we get</li>
        </ul></ul>

        <h3>What we will be making</h3>
        <p>Our end product will put all of the pieces we learn together to create a simple Twitter bot. Our bot will periodically tweet some pre-chosen phrases by us. The bot will also rudely respond to tweets unless properly addressed. (Manners are really really important) But enough fluff, let's get started.</p>
